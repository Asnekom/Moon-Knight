           <p class="main_text">The main personality is
               Mark Spector is a former mercenary who previously wanted to become a boxer.
               Becoming a hero is a separate difficult story in which he had to compete with his own brother,
               work for various organizations,
               including the CIA and even terrorists.              
            It all ends with a treasure hunt in Egypt,
            during which Spector is injured.
             He hardly crawls to an unknown temple and falls asleep at the statue of the Egyptian god of the moon,
             truth and justice Khonsu. Waking up cured of his wounds,
             Mark takes it for divine intervention and begins to go crazy on religious grounds.

             After that, the hero begins to take revenge on everyone because of whom he died (or almost died) during the treasure hunt.
              Along with this,
              he also has additional personalities.</p>
           <p>
            Spector considers himself absolutely reckless in some cases,
            because of which he dies - he is sure that Khonsu will resurrect him and if Khonsu dies,
            he will lose his power,
            but if he revives him,
            then the power will return to him.
           </p>
           <p> When he first appeared,
            Mark did not possess any superpowers at all,
            but only had a silver suit.
              The knight acquired divine gifts in the form of inhuman strength and endurance,
              complete disregard for all types of 
              damage and astral vision - but all this is available only in moonlight.</p>
